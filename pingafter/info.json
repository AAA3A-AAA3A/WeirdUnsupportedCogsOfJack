You're back with a coffee. WHAT THE FUCK BOT!? YOU FINISHED WHILE I WAS GONE!? You could nuke your bot into oblivion for being so rude to you, but I do have an alternative! *This cog* can make your bot be forced to ping you after the command you ran sends a message back to you. No more long staring or forgetting that you ran the command!",
